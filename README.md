# Project Zeta
Biostatistics research project in The Masters School science research program.

##Abstract
In this study I expand the work done with the potential of skewness as a measure in biostatistic analysis. Going beyond just the epigenetic expression and methylation datasets previously examined, I extent the measure into genetic data in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

##Methods
Applied the analysis of tails of the distributions of SNP datasets from the GDC.
